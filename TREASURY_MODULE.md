# Treasury Module: Build Plan and Status

_Created 2026-10-15. This file is the single source of truth for the treasury work: what it is, the order to build it in, and what is already done. **Update the status table whenever a step changes state.**_

---

## 1. What the treasury module is (and isn't)

MoneyUnify holds no money. Each provider pays into a **separate merchant account the operator owns** at that provider: a PayPal balance, a Lenco account, a pawaPay wallet, an MTN collection account. Providers almost never transfer to each other directly.

The treasury module lets an operator **see, track and rebalance** the money spread across those accounts, using the **prefunding and net settlement** model:

1. A **prefunded float** at a mobile-money provider (for example ZMW at pawaPay) pays recipients instantly.
2. Collections build up elsewhere (for example USD in PayPal).
3. Periodically, or when a float runs low, the operator **rebalances**: moves accumulated funds across, through a bank or a payout API, and tops the float back up.

**It is:** a ledger, balance visibility, float alerts, tracked transfers, and (last) AI-suggested rebalances that a person approves.

**It is not:**
- A wallet that holds customer money.
- An automatic mover of money without human approval.
- An FX engine. FX conversion is a separate, later feature (see §6).

## 3. Status at a glance

| # | Step | Status | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Foundations already in the switch | ✅ | none |
| 1 | Payouts (mobile money and bank) | ✅ | 0 |
| 2 | Ledger (double-entry, per provider account and currency) | ✅ | 0, 1 |
| 3 | Live provider balances | ⬜ | 2 |
| 4 | Float rules and low-float alerts | ✅ | 2, 3 |
| 5 | Treasury view (UI) | ✅ | 2, 3, 4 |
| 6 | Transfers with a lifecycle (manual and API) | 🟡 | 1, 2 |
| 7 | AI rebalancing suggestions (human-approved) | ⬜ | 4, 6, FX quoting (⏸) |

**Build strictly in this order.** Each step's acceptance criteria must pass before starting the next. For the hackathon demo, steps **1, 2, 4 and 5** are enough: PayPal collects, a prefunded float pays out instantly, and the treasury view shows when to rebalance.

---

## 4. Working rules (to avoid drift)

1. **One step at a time,** in the order above. Don't build ahead, for example transfers before payouts exist.
2. **Stay in scope.** If something useful falls outside the current step, add it to §7 (Parking lot) instead of building it.
3. **Reuse what exists** (§5, step 0). Don't duplicate fee maths, routing, provider logging or verification.
4. **Money maths uses `App\Support\Fees\FeeCalculator`** (exact decimals via `brick/math`, ISO 4217 precision). No floats for money.
5. **Every money movement needs a human approval and an audit trail.** Agents may *propose*; they never *execute* on their own.
6. **Tests with every step** (Pest, `Http::fake`, sandbox only). Update the status table and the step's "Done" list in the same change.
7. **Sandbox only** until the regulatory position (§8) is settled.

## 5. Steps in detail

### Step 0: Foundations already in the switch ✅

These exist today and must be reused, not rebuilt:

| Building block | Where | What it gives the treasury |
|---|---|---|
| Transactions with a fee breakdown | `transactions`: `collection_fee`, `settlement_fee`, `net_amount`, `fee_estimated` (filled by `app/Observers/TransactionObserver.php`) | Per-payment gross, fees and net |
| Direction column | `transactions.direction` enum `credit`/`debit` (only `credit` is used today) | Ready for payouts (`debit`) |
| FX columns | `transactions.is_fx`, `transactions.fx_rate` (present, never set yet) | Ready for FX later |
| Exact fee maths and quotes | `app/Support/Fees/FeeCalculator.php`, `PaymentQuoter.php`, `POST /api/v1/payment/quote` | Costing transfers and payouts |
| Actual provider fees | `ProviderFees::actualCollectionFee()` and a driver hook (PayPal implements it) | Real fees, not estimates |
| Shared routing | `app/Support/ProviderRouter.php` | Choosing a payout provider the same way as collections |
| Provider call logging | `app/Support/ProviderCallLogger.php` (secrets redacted) | Audit of every provider call |
| Verify and notify | `app/Support/TransactionVerifier.php` | Reconciling pending operations |
| Per-provider account totals | `ProviderController::accountSummaries()` (successful credits: inflow, fees, net, `estimated`) | First version of balances (see step 2) |
| AI agent infrastructure | `app/Ai/Concerns/UsesAccountAiCredentials.php`, `app/Support/Ai/AiProviderChain.php`, `ConnectionCheck`, AI & Agents page | Step 7's agent |

---

### Step 1: Payouts ✅

**Goal:** the switch can send money out (to a mobile wallet or bank account) through providers that support it, with the same fallback, fee and logging guarantees as collections.

**Same scope as [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) §4.3–4.4.** Build it once; mark it done in both files.

**Already exists:** the `debit` direction value, routing, fee maths and logging.

**To build:**
- `app/Contracts/PayoutProviderInterface.php`: `requestPayout(Transaction $transaction, array $recipient): JsonResponse` and `verifyPayout(Transaction $transaction): JsonResponse`.
- A `PayoutRouter`, or an extension of `ProviderRouter` for payout-capable drivers: filter by country and currency, cost-aware order, sequential fallback. Never time out a connected call early, so nobody is paid twice.
- Drivers: **pawaPay first** (public sandbox with payouts), then Lenco, MTN Disbursement and Airtel as their payout APIs are confirmed.
- `SandboxPayoutController`: a simulated driver (non-production only) whose outcome is set by the MSISDN suffix, for deterministic demos.
- API: `POST /api/v1/payout/request` and `POST /api/v1/payout/verify`, documented in `prezet/content/api/`.
- Payout transactions are written with `direction = 'debit'`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A sandbox payout succeeds end to end, and falls back to the next provider when the first fails.
- A payout never runs twice for one request (idempotent provider reference).
- Fees are recorded with the same estimated/actual rules as collections.

**Tests:** payout fallback, idempotency, fees, `debit` direction, API validation.

**Done (2026-10-15):**
- `app/Contracts/PayoutProviderInterface.php`: `setProvider`, `requestPayout(Transaction, array $recipient)`, `verifyPayout`. 2xx means accepted, 4xx a definite refusal (fallback is safe), and 5xx an unknown outcome (the switch stops).
- Routing reuses `ProviderRouter::route(..., capability: PayoutProviderInterface::class)` instead of a separate PayoutRouter. Collections never route to payout-only drivers, and vice versa.
- `app/Http/Controllers/PayoutController.php`: `POST /api/v1/payout/request` and `POST /api/v1/payout/verify`. It creates the `debit` transaction before calling the driver, falls back only on 4xx, and stops on 5xx or an exception (`202 pending`).
- **Idempotency:** the `Idempotency-Key` header, stored in `transactions.idempotency_key`. A replay returns the original payout, a cache lock stops concurrent duplicates (`409`), and the key is re-checked under the lock.
- **pawaPay** (`PawapayController`): `POST /payouts` and `GET /payouts/{id}`, with the payout id = our transaction id, plus a `live`/`sandbox` **Environment** config field (default live).
- **`SandboxPayoutController`:** `SANDBOX_ONLY`, so it's hidden and refused in production and excluded from coverage. Outcomes are set by the number suffix (0000 refused, 9999 unknown, 1111 fails later).
- **Fees:** schedules gain an optional `payout` section (`FeeCalculator::payoutFee`). For a debit, `net_amount` is `amount + fee`, the total taken from the float.
- **Shared pieces:** `TransactionVerifier` verifies debits through `verifyPayout`. `DriverRegistry` centralises driver discovery and capabilities, and `Market::msisdn()` normalises numbers.
- **Docs and tests:** `prezet/content/api/payouts.md`; tests in `tests/Feature/PayoutTest.php` (20).

---

### Step 2: Ledger ✅

**Goal:** a reconcilable record of every movement per **provider account and currency**, so a balance is always explainable.

**Already exists (the partial part):**
- Per-transaction gross, fees and net (step 0).
- `ProviderController::accountSummaries()` sums **successful credits** per provider and currency. That's a derived total, not a ledger: no debits, no transfers, no opening balances.

**To build:**
- `ledger_entries` table: `id`, `user_id`, `payment_provider_id`, `currency`, `amount` (signed decimal, currency precision), `type` (`collection`, `fee`, `payout`, `transfer_out`, `transfer_in`, `adjustment`, `opening_balance`), a polymorphic `source` (transaction or transfer), `occurred_at`, `meta` JSON, timestamps.
- **Double-entry rule:** every money event writes balanced entries. For example, a collection writes `+gross` collection and `−fee` fee.
- Write entries when a transaction **settles** (from `TransactionObserver` or a listener), never on pending.
- `LedgerBalance` service: balance per provider and currency = sum of entries. Replace `accountSummaries()` with it.
- `opening_balance` entries, so an operator can align the ledger with a real account once.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The ledger balance equals the sum of settled collections minus fees minus payouts plus/minus transfers, to the minor unit.
- Re-saving a transaction never duplicates entries.

**Tests:** entry creation per event type, idempotency, balance maths in zero- and two-decimal currencies.

**Done (2026-10-15):**
- `ledger_entries` table: `account` (provider / counterparty / fees), `type`, `currency`, **`amount_minor` as a signed integer in minor units** (so sums are exact), `estimated`, a morph `source`, `occurred_at` and `meta`. It's unique per (source, type, account).
- `App\Enums\LedgerAccount` and `LedgerEntryType`, plus the `App\Models\LedgerEntry` model.
- `App\Support\Ledger\LedgerRecorder::sync()`, run from `TransactionObserver::saved()`. A settled transaction gets balanced pairs (collection or payout ±amount, fee ±fees) that sum to zero. A fee change (estimate → PayPal actual) updates the entries in place, and unsettling removes them.
- `recordOpeningBalance()` and `LedgerBalance::of()` / `summaries()`. The provider **Accounts** dialog now reads from the ledger (outflows include payouts).
- Commands: `php artisan ledger:rebuild` (backfill, idempotent) and `php artisan ledger:opening-balance {provider} {currency} {amount} --note=`.
- `Currency::toMinorUnits()` / `fromMinorUnits()` for exact conversion.
- Tests in `tests/Feature/LedgerTest.php` (13), including "every event sums to zero".

**Not done (left for later steps):** an `adjustment` UI, and transfer entries (step 6).

---

### Step 3: Live provider balances ⬜

**Goal:** show the provider's **real** balance next to the ledger, and flag mismatches.

**To build:**
- An optional driver contract `ReportsBalance`: `balances(): array<currency, string>`. Implement it only where the provider has a balance API. Confirm each against the provider's docs before implementing (pawaPay, Lenco, Flutterwave and the MTN/Airtel disbursement accounts are the likely candidates).
- `BalanceSnapshot` records (provider, currency, amount, fetched_at), refreshed on demand and on a schedule (`routes/console.php`).
- Mismatch check: |provider balance − ledger balance| above a tolerance is flagged for review, never auto-corrected.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Balances fetched in the sandbox are stored and shown.
- Providers without a balance API show "ledger only".

**Tests:** snapshot storage, mismatch flagging, providers without the contract.

---

### Step 4: Float rules and alerts ✅

**Goal:** an operator sets "keep at least X in provider P's currency C", and is told when it drops below.

**To build:**
- `float_rules` table: provider, currency, `minimum`, optional `target`, `is_active`.
- `FloatMonitor` service: compares the ledger (or live) balance against rules and raises alerts. Show alerts in the dashboard first; email or webhook later.

**Acceptance criteria:** a balance below its minimum raises exactly one open alert, which clears when the balance recovers.

**Tests:** threshold crossing in both directions, no duplicate alerts.

**Done (2026-10-15):**
- `float_rules` (provider, currency, `minimum_minor`, `target_minor`, `is_active`) and `float_alerts` (`balance_minor`, `minimum_minor`, `opened_at`, `resolved_at`). Models `FloatRule` (with `openAlert`) and `FloatAlert`.
- `App\Support\Treasury\FloatMonitor`: one open alert per rule, refreshed while low and resolved on recovery. Inactive rules never alert.
- Runs automatically: `LedgerRecorder` re-checks the affected accounts after every write (transactions, transfers, opening balances). Plus `php artisan treasury:check-floats`, scheduled every five minutes in `routes/console.php`.
- Dashboard alerts on the Treasury page. Email and webhook alerts remain in the parking lot.
- Tests in `tests/Feature/TreasuryTest.php`.

---

### Step 5: Treasury view (UI) ✅

**Goal:** one page with each provider account's balance, float status and recent movements.

**Already exists (the partial part):** the provider **Accounts** dialog (`resources/js/pages/providers/index.tsx`) shows each account's ledger balance per currency (inflows; fees and payouts out; net), with an `Est.` marker. As of step 2 it reads from `LedgerBalance`.

**To build:**
- A `Treasury` page in the sidebar, using the existing card, table and badge patterns:
  - per provider account and currency: ledger balance, live balance (when available), float status;
  - recent ledger entries;
  - open alerts.
- Point the Accounts dialog at the ledger balance once step 2 lands.

**Acceptance criteria:** the numbers match `LedgerBalance` exactly. Responsive at phone width. Empty states handled.

**Tests:** Inertia props for balances, entries and alerts.

**Done (2026-10-15):**
- `TreasuryController@index` and the `resources/js/pages/treasury/index.tsx` page, with a **Treasury** item in the sidebar.
- Accounts table: ledger balance, `Est.` marker, money in transit, minimum float and status (Healthy, Below minimum, No float rule), with **Set float** / **Edit float**.
- Float alerts with a **Top up** button that pre-fills a transfer.
- Transfers with per-status actions and a History view, plus recent ledger activity.
- `FloatRuleController` (`PUT /treasury/float-rules`, `DELETE /treasury/float-rules/{floatRule}`).
- **Not included:** live provider balances (step 3, still ⬜). The view shows ledger balances only.

---

### Step 6: Transfers 🟡

**Goal:** track moving money from one provider account to another, end to end.

**To build:**
- `treasury_transfers` table: source account (provider and currency), destination account, `amount`, `fees`, `status`, `method` (`api` or `manual`), `reference`, `approved_by`, timestamps.
- Lifecycle: `requested → approved → in_transit → settled`, or `failed` / `cancelled`. Every transition is logged.
- **API transfers:** where a payout API reaches the destination account, for example Lenco to a bank, or a payout into a float top-up account.
- **Manual transfers:** for example PayPal to bank. The operator confirms each stage, and the switch tracks and reconciles.
- Ledger: `transfer_out` on the source when sent, `transfer_in` on the destination when settled. Money in transit is visible, not lost.
- Fees come from `FeeCalculator`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A transfer can't start without approval.
- A settled transfer moves both ledger balances by exactly the amount, less fees.
- A failed transfer reverses its `transfer_out`.

**Tests:** lifecycle transitions, approval gate, ledger effects, failure reversal.

**Done (2026-10-15), manual transfers:**
- `treasury_transfers` (`reference`, from and to provider, `currency`, `amount_minor`, `fee_minor`, `received_minor`, `status`, `method`, `external_reference`, `note`, `failure_reason`, timestamps) and `treasury_transfer_events` (who, from, to, note, when).
- `App\Enums\TransferStatus` with `canTransitionTo()`.
- `App\Support\Treasury\TransferService`: `request`, `approve`, `send`, `settle`, `fail`, `cancel`. Each transition locks the row, checks it's allowed, records an event and syncs the ledger. Approving and sending require the source's ledger balance to cover the amount plus the fee.
- `LedgerRecorder::syncTransfer()`:
  - **in transit:** `transfer_out` (source −amount, counterparty +amount) plus the fee;
  - **settled:** also `transfer_in` (destination +received);
  - any shortfall becomes an `adjustment` fee;
  - **failed / cancelled:** no entries.
  Every transfer sums to zero.
- `TreasuryTransferController` (`POST /treasury/transfers`, plus `/{transfer}/approve|send|settle|fail|cancel`): ownership checks and currency-precision validation. Same currency only (FX deferred).

**Not done:** API-executed transfers (`method = api`, sent through a payout API). Only `manual` exists today.

---

### Step 7: AI rebalancing suggestions ⬜

**Goal:** an agent watches floats and expected payout volume, then **proposes** a rebalance (amount, route, fees, FX cost) for a person to approve.

**Prerequisites:** steps 4 and 6, plus **FX quoting** (⏸, §6) for cross-currency routes.

**To build:**
- A `TreasuryAgent` (Laravel AI SDK, `UsesAccountAiCredentials`) with read-only tools: balances, float rules, recent volume, transfer routes and quotes. Plus one **approval-required** tool that creates a `requested` transfer.
- Suggestions are shown in the treasury view, and approving one moves the transfer to `approved` (step 6).

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The agent can't approve or execute on its own.
- Every suggestion shows its reasoning and costs.

**Tests:** agent fakes (`TreasuryAgent::fake()`), the approval gate, tool outputs.

---

## 6. Deferred: FX quoting ⏸

Needed for cross-currency rebalancing (for example USD in PayPal to a ZMW float) and for PayPal payments priced in ZMW (PayPal can't charge ZMW). It's planned to sit **on top of** the fee quote:
- the price in the source currency;
- the rate source and margin;
- the converted amount in a PayPal-supported currency;
- fees in each currency;
- what lands in the destination currency.

It should set `transactions.is_fx` and `fx_rate`. **Don't start without a decision on the rate source and margin.**

---

## 7. Parking lot (ideas outside the current step)

_Add ideas here instead of building them mid-step._

- Email/webhook delivery for float alerts (step 4 starts with dashboard alerts only).
- Scheduled automatic rebalancing (only ever after step 7, still human-approved).
- API-executed transfers (step 6 `method = api`) through payout APIs.
- Requiring a different person to approve a transfer than the one who requested it (accounts are single-user today).

---

## 8. Regulatory note

Collecting money and paying it out to other people, especially across borders, is **money transmission**. In Zambia that falls under the Bank of Zambia and the National Payment Systems Act. Going live normally needs a licence, or operating under a licensed partner (an aggregator or a bank). PayPal's terms also restrict remittance-style use of a standard merchant account without approval. **Build and demo in sandbox only** until this is settled.
