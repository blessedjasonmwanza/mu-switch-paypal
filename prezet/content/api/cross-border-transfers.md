title: Cross-Border Transfers
excerpt: Let a sender pay with PayPal and deliver the money to a mobile wallet in another currency, at a locked exchange rate, with an automatic refund if it can't be delivered.

A cross-border transfer connects two accounts **you already own**:

1. A **PayPal** business account, where the sender pays (for example USD).
2. A **mobile-money payout** account, such as pawaPay, that holds a float in the
   recipient's currency (for example ZMW).

No money moves between PayPal and the mobile-money provider during the
transfer. The sender pays into your PayPal account, and the recipient is paid
from your payout float. You rebalance the two accounts later, for example with
[Treasury](/docs/treasury) transfers. This is the prefunding model that
remittance companies use, and it's why the recipient is paid in seconds.

## How a transfer works

```
quote → awaiting_payment → funded → paying_out → delivered
                         ↘ payment_failed      ↘ payout_failed → refunding → refunded
```

1. **Quote.** The switch locks an exchange rate (see
   [Exchange Rates & FX Quotes](/docs/api/fx)), checks that your PayPal account
   can collect and that a payout provider can deliver, and estimates the fees.
2. **Pay with PayPal.** `request` creates a PayPal order and returns a
   `checkout_url`. The sender approves the payment on PayPal.
3. **Pay out.** As soon as PayPal confirms the capture (the sender's return,
   the [PayPal webhook](/docs/providers) or `verify`), the switch pays the
   recipient's wallet from your payout account. It uses the same payout routing
   as [Send a Payout](/docs/api/payouts), so it falls back across providers but
   never pays twice.
4. **Delivered or refunded.** When the payout provider confirms, the transfer
   is `delivered`. If every payout provider refuses, or the payout fails, the
   switch **refunds the sender's PayPal payment in full**, automatically.

Both legs record the exchange rate (`is_fx` and `fx_rate` on each transaction),
and the [ledger](/docs/treasury) shows the money arriving at PayPal, leaving
the payout float and, if needed, being refunded.

### Who pays the fees

The sender pays exactly `sender_pays`, and the recipient gets exactly
`recipient_gets`. The provider fees (PayPal's fee on the payment and the payout
provider's fee) are paid by **you, the operator**, from your own accounts.
They're shown as `operator_fees` so you can price your margin. Your income is
the FX margin (`fx.margin_amount`).

## Authentication

Required for every endpoint. Send your API token as a Bearer token. See
[Authentication](/docs/api/authentication).

## Quote a transfer

```http
POST /api/v1/transfer/quote
```

| Field | Type | Rules | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amount` | number | required, `> 0` | The amount. Its meaning depends on `mode`. |
| `mode` | string | nullable, `target` or `source` | `target` (default): the recipient gets exactly `amount`. `source`: the sender pays exactly `amount`. |
| `country` | string | required, 2 letters | The recipient's country, e.g. `ZM`. |
| `currency` | string | nullable, 3 letters | The recipient's currency. Defaults to the country's own (`ZMW` for `ZM`). |
| `source_currency` | string | nullable, 3 letters | The currency the sender pays in on PayPal. Defaults to `USD`. |
| `fx_quote_id` | string | nullable | Use a quote you already locked with [`POST /api/v1/fx/quote`](/docs/api/fx). It must be yours, unexpired, and for the same currencies. |

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/transfer/quote \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{ "amount": 2500, "country": "ZM" }'
```

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Transfer quoted",
  "data": {
    "fx_quote_id": "2653c984-4e7f-4b34-b338-91ec79fecda0",
    "sender_pays": { "amount": "92.30", "currency": "USD" },
    "recipient_gets": { "amount": "2500.00", "currency": "ZMW" },
    "fx": {
      "base_rate": "27.50000000",
      "effective_rate": "27.08750000",
      "margin_percent": "1.5",
      "margin_amount": "1.38"
    },
    "operator_fees": {
      "paypal": { "amount": "3.71", "currency": "USD" },
      "payout": { "amount": "25.00", "currency": "ZMW" },

    },

    "country": "ZM",
    "expires_at": "2026-10-15T17:24:09+00:00"
  }
}
```

`payout_route` lists the payout providers in the order they'll be tried.
Quoting never contacts a provider and never moves money.

## Start a transfer

```http
POST /api/v1/transfer/request
```

Takes every quote field, plus:

| Field | Type | Rules | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `account_number` | string | required | The recipient's mobile-money number, local or international format. |
| `recipient_name` | string | nullable | Shown in the transfer's details. |
| `network` | string | nullable | The recipient's network, when the payout provider can't detect it. |
| `narration` | string | nullable, max 100 | Shown to the recipient where the provider supports it. |
| `payer_email` | string | nullable, email | Pre-fills the sender's PayPal login. |
| `return_url` | string | nullable, URL | Where PayPal sends the sender after paying. |

Send an `Idempotency-Key` header to make retries safe: the same key returns
the original transfer (with `"replayed": true`) instead of starting another.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/transfer/request \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: send-mum-2026-10-15" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 2500,
    "country": "ZM",
    "account_number": "0977123456",
    "recipient_name": "Mum",
    "payer_email": "chipo@example.com",
    "return_url": "https://your-app.com/sent"
  }'
```

```json
{
  "status": "awaiting_payment",
  "message": "Transfer started. Send the sender to checkout_url to pay with PayPal.",
  "data": {
    "reference": "7f0c6c1e-3b5a-4c55-9a1d-2b7f3f9e8a10",

      "effective_rate": "27.08750000",
      "margin_percent": "1.5000",
      "margin_amount": "1.38"
    },
    "funding": { "provider": "PayPal", "transaction_id": "9b1d…", "status": "pending" },
    "timeline": [

    ]
  }
}
```

Redirect the sender to `checkout_url`. Nothing is paid out until PayPal
confirms the payment.

## Check a transfer

```http
POST /api/v1/transfer/verify
```

| Field | Type | Rules | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference` | string | required | The transfer's `reference`. |

`verify` re-checks whichever leg is in progress (the PayPal payment, the
payout or the refund), moves the transfer forward, and returns it with its
`funding`, `payout`, `refund` and full `timeline`. It's safe to call at any
time. Webhooks and the sender's return from PayPal move transfers forward on
their own; `verify` is the fallback.

| `status` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `awaiting_payment` | Waiting for the sender to pay on PayPal. |
| `funded` | PayPal captured the payment; the payout is starting. |
| `paying_out` | The payout provider is delivering to the wallet. |
| `delivered` | The recipient was paid. **Final.** |
| `payment_failed` | The sender didn't complete the PayPal payment. Nothing was paid out. **Final.** |
| `payout_failed` | The payout couldn't be delivered; the refund is starting. |
| `refunding` | PayPal is processing the refund. |
| `refunded` | The sender's PayPal payment was refunded in full. **Final.** |
| `refund_failed` | PayPal refused the refund. Call `verify` to retry it; the retry reuses the same PayPal request, so the sender is never refunded twice. |

A transfer can only be read by the account that created it.

## Errors

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | No active PayPal account can collect the currency, no payout provider can deliver to the country, or no exchange rate exists for the pair. Nothing is created. |
| `401` | The API token is missing or invalid. |
| `404` | The transfer doesn't exist or belongs to another account. |
| `409` | A request with the same `Idempotency-Key` is still being processed. |
| `422` | A field fails validation, or the `fx_quote_id` is for different currencies. |
| `502` | PayPal couldn't start the payment. The transfer is marked `payment_failed`. |

See [Responses & Errors](/docs/api/responses) for the response envelope.

## Set up (operator)

1. On the **Providers** page, add your **PayPal** account (collects the
   sender's payment) and at least one **payout** provider for the recipient's
   country, such as pawaPay. Tick the countries each one serves.
2. Keep a float in the payout account, in the recipient's currency. Set a float
   rule on the **Treasury** page so you're alerted before it runs low.
3. Run a queue worker (`php artisan queue:work`). Payouts and refunds run as
   queued jobs as soon as PayPal confirms a payment.
4. In sandbox, the **Simulated Payouts** driver lets you test every outcome:
   numbers ending `0000` are refused (so the sender is refunded), and `1111`
   fails after acceptance.
